# webpack-config

My boilerplate webpack config. Includes copious comments and a skeleton file system showing how webpack engages with your filesystem.

Before you do anything, type "npm run package-install" into your command line, which will everything necessary that's related to webpack. When it's done, run "npm run build". Then check out /dist/index.html in your browser!

The meat of this demo is in webpack.config.js itself. You shouldn't need to look anywhere else.
